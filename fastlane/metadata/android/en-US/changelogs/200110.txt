What's new:
* Better user experience with tabs instead of Navigation Drawer menu.
* It's now easier to find media with the new search bar. You could also ask the Google Assistant with voice commands such as "Play Daft Punk on Odeon".
* Free some device space by listing and deleting songs that you may have not listened for some time.
